        A strong self-introduction includes who you are, what you do and what others need to know about you. When you deliver a powerful self-introduction, you can make a lasting positive impression.
        In this article, we define a self-introduction and offer you tips and examples so you can write your own effective self-introduction.

        When do you use a self-introduction?
        You should offer a self-introduction any time you meet someone new and there isn't someone present to introduce you. The following are specific instances where a self-introduction might be helpful:
        At the beginning of an interview
        While attending a hiring event
        When networking with new connections
        While giving a presentation
        When meeting people at a trade show or conference
        A self-introduction should include your name and occupation (or desired occupation) and key facts that will help you make an impression on the person you're communicating with. In a few sentences, cover the most important things others need to know about you.

        How to prepare a self-introduction 
        Whether you plan to deliver your self-introduction verbally or in writing, drafting a sample of what you want to say in advance is helpful. These steps will help you create an effective self-introduction:
        1. Summarize your professional standing
        The first sentence of your self-introduction should include your name, job title or experience. If you're unemployed and seeking a job, you might mention your educational degree, certification level or current place in your job search.
        For example:
        "My name is Jordan Lin, and I'm a recent computer science graduate from Stanford University."
        "I'm Avery Lucas, and I'm seeking an entry-level warehousing job that will use my organization, attention to detail and time management skills."
        "My name is Rylan Curtis, and I'm a chief engineer for Jacobs and Associates."

        2. Briefly explain your work experience and key accomplishments
        Customize this part of the introduction to highlight the details most relevant to the person you're communicating with. If you're in a job interview, discuss your professional skills and accomplishments. If you're giving a presentation, offer information that supports your authority in the area you're discussing. When you're introducing yourself to a potential client, mention your products and services.
        "I have over 10 years of experience in marketing, specifically focusing on social media campaigns for rising tech companies."
        3. End with a lead-in to the next part of the conversation
        Keep your introduction short and conclude it by leading into what you'd like to happen next. For a presentation, you would summarize what you plan to discuss. In an interview, mention why you're the best person for the job. A self-introduction to a new client or colleague should end with a call to action.
        "Feel free to contact me if you have any questions. I'm happy to share more about our marketing services and how they could expand your company's social media presence."

        You may deliver many types of self-introductions at various points throughout your career. Below are samples suited to some of the most common situations you may encounter:
        For a job interview
        "My name is Riley See. I'm a recent elementary education graduate from Ball State University. I've been working at a camp for elementary children this summer, and I'm excited to find my first teaching position for the coming school year. I have several original lesson plans I created during my teaching internship that I look forward to implementing in my own classroom. I attended Brookwood Elementary myself and believe I would be a great fit for your second-grade opening. It would be a joy for me to teach students in the same place that sparked my love of learning."

I believe establishing money management strategies as early as possible is the key to securing your future. I began using these strategies myself as I worked through college, and I now have over $10 million in my retirement fund. That amount is growing every day, and I'm here to teach you how to set up an account like that, too."
        For networking

We're developing some innovative marketing campaigns designed to engage new customers right in the streets of Bloomington. I've been recruiting local businesses that want to get involved in these activities. I love chatting with residents around the area and learning more about what they're looking for from their smart devices."

        Self-introduction email example
        A self-introduction email is a message sent to someone you have never met with information about who you are. To receive a response, the email needs to capture the attention and engage the interest of its recipient. Here is a sample to help you create your own:
