<h1>Low poly Character</h1>

<h3></h3>
<p>I'm going to make a 3D character, Low poly girl with a brown hair with a yellow T-shirt, and the design is going to be 
    a normal and simple design. And it needs to rigged for it to move.
   Requiurments: Head, Arms, Legs and Torso. </p>
   
    <h3>End users</h3>
    <p>My end users are age 11 or above who likes to play online games, and i want it to be globally.
        I think they will expect my character to look like to be character in a escape game or a farm game.
