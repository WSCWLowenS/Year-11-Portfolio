<h1>Low poly Character</h1>

<h3></h3>
<p>I'm going to make a 3D character, Low poly girl with a brown hair with a yellow T-shirt, and the design is going to be 
    a normal and simple design. And it needs to rigged for it to move.
   Requiurments: Head, Arms, Legs and Torso. </p>
   
    <h3>End users</h3>
    <p>My end users are elementary or above who likes to play online games, and i like the language to be english
         because it's the foremost common language and the it's likely to be the global language.</p>
